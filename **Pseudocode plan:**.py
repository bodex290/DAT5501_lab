**Pseudocode plan:**
1. Identify the function to test in `unittest.py`. Since the file is empty, assume the function is not present.
2. If the function is missing, no tests can be generated.
3. If you want tests for a specific function, please provide its code.

**No code to test is present in `unittest.py`. Please provide the function you want to test.**
