# 🌍 Interactive Rule of Law Index Map  
**An OWID-style interactive global choropleth visualisation built with Python & Plotly**

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project recreates an interactive world map for the **Rule of Law Index**, inspired by the visualisation published by **Our World in Data (OWID)**.  

The script automatically fetches the official OWID dataset, processes it into a clean analytical format, and generates a fully interactive choropleth with:

- A **year slider** for temporal exploration  
- **Play/pause animation controls**  
- **Hover interactions** showing country-level values  
- A high-contrast **OWID-style colour scheme**  
- A standalone **HTML output** compatible with any browser  

This interactive tool allows users to visualise global shifts in the Rule of Law Index across time.

## 🎯 Purpose  
The project demonstrates skills in:

- Extracting and processing real-world datasets  
- Building interactive data visualisations with Plotly  
- Designing reproducible analysis workflows  
- Communicating insights through intuitive visual storytelling  

It forms part of my **DAT5501 Analysis, Software and Career Practice** portfolio and showcases good practice in data analysis, presentation, and GitHub documentation.
