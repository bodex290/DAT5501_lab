## üìò Overview

This repository contains my **DAT5501 Portfolio** for *Analysis, Software and Career Practice*.  
It showcases my weekly coding activities, data analysis workflows, and applied technical exercises completed throughout the semester.  

Each sub-folder documents an individual activity, including well-commented source code, a clear commit history, a dedicated `README.md`, and unit tests where applicable.

> The portfolio demonstrates the development of **Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs)** required for a data analytics professional, focusing on reproducibility, testing, and clear communication of technical work.

## üß† Learning Focus

Each activity contributes to the development of professional KSBs defined in the module brief:

| Category | KSB | Description |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| **Knowledge** | K53 | Barriers to effective data analysis and stakeholder communication |
| | K54 | Interpreting and evaluating complex information from diverse datasets |
| | K57 | Data processing, storage, and analytical decision-making |
| | K59 | Applying analytics to improve business operations |
| | K60 | Ethical and legal considerations in data analytics |
| **Skills** | S49 | Apply data analysis methods to drive improvement |
| | S50 | Present and communicate analysis outputs effectively |
| | S51 | Identify and overcome barriers to effective analysis |
| | S53 | Validate and test analysis results |
| | S55 | Analyse large datasets using industry-standard tools |

## üßÆ Key Activities

### 1. [Duration Calculator](./DAT5501_lab/DurationCalculator/README.md)
A Python utility that:
- Calculates how many days a given date is from today.  
- Extends to multiple dates loaded from a CSV.  
- Includes unit tests, data cleaning, and NumPy-based day precision.  

> Demonstrates **S49**, **S50**, and **S53** through applied analysis and testing.

---

### 2. [World Rule of Law Map](./DAT5501_lab/RuleOfLawMap/README.md)
An interactive choropleth map visualising the **World Justice Project‚Äôs Rule of Law Index**, using data from *Our World in Data (OWID)*.  
Includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning with pandas.  
- GeoPandas / Plotly visualisation.  
- Year selector interactivity (slider).

> Demonstrates **K54**, **S50**, and **S55** through visual storytelling and data exploration.

---

### 3. [Data Pipeline CI](./DAT5501_lab/DataPipelineCI/README.md)
A demonstration of a **Continuous Integration (CI)** setup for a data-analysis workflow.  
Includes:
- Unit testing a line-fitting model.  
- Integration with CircleCI or GitHub Actions.  
- Synthetic data generation and validation.

> Demonstrates **S53** and **K57** through automated testing and reproducible pipelines.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DAT5501_lab.git
   cd DAT5501_lab

2.	Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate       # macOS/Linux
    # venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows PowerShell
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3.	Run any activity module, for example:
    ```bash
    python DAT5501_lab/DurationCalculator/duration_calculator.py

4. Run all unit tests:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover
    

üß™ Testing & Validation

All activities include testing files following the unittest structure.
Continuous Integration (CI) setup can be extended via:
	‚Ä¢	CircleCI (.circleci/config.yml)
	‚Ä¢	GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/python-tests.yml)

Testing ensures:
	‚Ä¢	Functions return expected results.
	‚Ä¢	Error handling for invalid input.
	‚Ä¢	Data is parsed correctly before computation.

‚∏ª

üìÑ Documentation & Professional Practice
	‚Ä¢	Each folder contains a local README.md documenting code logic, input formats, and expected outputs.
	‚Ä¢	Clear inline comments and docstrings for maintainability.
	‚Ä¢	Frequent commits with descriptive messages following a professional workflow.
	‚Ä¢	Code formatted according to PEP 8 style guidelines.

‚∏ª

üß≠ Reflection (for portfolio submission)

This portfolio demonstrates progressive development across multiple coding contexts.
Each project emphasises:
	‚Ä¢	Analytical thinking and validation.
	‚Ä¢	Professional documentation and reproducibility.
	‚Ä¢	Real-world data handling using Python, pandas, and NumPy.
	‚Ä¢	Ethical and legal awareness in data processing.
